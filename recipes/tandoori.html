    <p>Tandoori chicken is a special recipe from South East Asian where the chicken is marinated overnight in a special 
        mixture of spices and then cooked in a special oven called the Tandoor. However, for our purposes any source of heat is fine. There is debate is to when this

    <h2><em>Steps</em></h2>
    <h3>Marinade for Tandoori Chicken</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To a mixing bowl, add greek yogurt or hung curd (thick curd). If you do not have it make your own following the notes below.</li>
        <li>Next, add in ginger garlic paste, garam masala, red chilli powder, salt, tumeric, kasuri methi, pepper powder and coriander powder.</li>
        <li>Pour oil and lemon juice as well.</li>
        <li>Mix everthing well. The marinade has to be thick and not of dripping consistency. Taste it and add more salt and chilli powder if needed.</li>
        <li>Make deep gashes over the chicken and add it to the bowl</li>
        <li>Marinate the chicken well into the gashes.</li>
        <li>Cover and set aside for at least 6 hours. If you reduce the marination time, the chicken will not turn soft and juicy</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>How to Make Tandoori Chicken</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to the highest for at least 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place a foil on a oven tray to collect the drippings</li>
        <li>Then keep a greased wire rack on the tray</li>
        <li>Place the chicken pieces over the wire rack</li>
        <li>Grill the chicken for about 15 minutes</li>
        <li>For a spicy version mix together 1 tsp of red chilli powder with 1 tbsp of oil</li>
        <li>After 15 minutes of grilling, baste the red chili oil over the chicken. You can also baste the leftover marinade over the chicken.</li>
        <li>Turn the chicken to the other side and baste the red chili oil or marinade</li>
        <li>Grill for another 6 to 10 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. You will need to adjust the timing as it depends on the size
            of the chicken pieces.</li>
        <li>The last 5 minutes set to broil mode.</li>
