        <!--Ingredients for recipe-->
        <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>

        <h3>For the cream</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 cup of mascarpone</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>For the Assembly</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 and 3/4 cups of good expresso or very strong coffee</li>
            <li>2 tbsps of rum or cognac</li>
            <li>2 tbsps unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>24 lady fingers</li>
            <li>1 to 2 oz of bittersweet chocolate (optional)</li>

        </ul>

        <!--Steps for recipe-->
        <h2><em>Steps</em></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Using an electric mixer in a medium bowl, whip together egg yolks and ¼ cup/50 grams sugar until 
                very pale yellow and about tripled in volume. A slight ribbon should fall from the beaters 
                (or whisk attachment) when lifted from the bowl. Transfer mixture to a large bowl, wiping out 
                the medium bowl used to whip the yolks and set aside.</li>
            <li>In the medium bowl, whip cream and remaining ¼ cup/50 grams sugar until it creates soft-medium 
                peaks. Add mascarpone and continue to whip until it creates a soft, spreadable mixture with medium 
                peaks. Gently fold the mascarpone mixture into the sweetened egg yolks until combined.</li>
            <li>Combine espresso and rum in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Using a sifter, dust the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish (an 8x8-inch dish, or a 9-inch 
                round cake pan would also work here) with 1 tablespoon cocoa powder.</li>
            <li>Working one at a time, quickly dip each ladyfinger into the espresso mixture -- they are 
                quite porous and will fall apart if left in the liquid too long -- and place them rounded
                 side up at the bottom of the baking dish. Repeat, using half the ladyfingers, until you’ve 
                 got an even layer, breaking the ladyfingers in half as needed to fill in any obvious gaps 
                 (a little space in between is O.K.). Spread half the mascarpone mixture onto the ladyfingers 
                 in one even layer. Repeat with remaining espresso-dipped ladyfingers and mascarpone mixture.</li>
            
        </ol>
